# Overview
The JMS Server and bluetooth work independently from eachother which unfortunately resulted in an average grade, however, I spent many hours on this so I decided to include it in my Github anyway.

Android Studio: MessagingApp                             
Netbeans 8.2 & Glassfish 5: MessagingService                 

Refer to Screenshots for further insight

MessagingApp coding: /MessageApp/app/src/main/java/com/example/messageapp             
MessagingService coding: /MessagingService/src/java/messagingservice

This should work provided glassfish 5 is available (although this is not tested on another pc)
